## Past Workshops

We host a number of workshops throughout the year and often they are
sponsored by the [Python Software Foundation](http://www.python.org/psf/)
or local companies such as
[Brightscope](http://www.brightscope.com/),
[Cuker Interactive](http://www.cukerinteractive.com/) or
[Qualcomm](http://qualcomm.com).

If there is something in particular you would like to see, feel free
to mention it to the
[San Diego Python organizers](http://www.meetup.com/pythonsd/suggestion/)
