We had about 30 people attend our
[Django Day workshop](http://www.meetup.com/pythonsd/events/95751792/).
We had both an intro track for people new to Django and an intermediate
track for those who attended our previous
[Intro to Django workshop](http://www.meetup.com/pythonsd/events/83842622/)
or have Django experience. Thanks to
[Cuker](http://cukerinteractive.com) for sponsoring today's event!

The code and slides are up on
[github](https://github.com/pythonsd/learning-django).

In April we will be having a
[Python for Data Analysis](http://www.meetup.com/pythonsd/events/94234812/)
workshop sponsored by Qualcomm's Open Source Portal group. Sign up before
it fills up!
