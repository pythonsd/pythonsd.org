Eric Busboom presented a data toolchain that could help our community analyze
large public datasets with the goal of reducing the impact of crime.  The
meeting focused on programming tools used for analysis, the challenge of
acquiring high quality data, and questions the data analysis might answer.

The San Diego Data [Crime Analysis] page includes [Meeting notes][] for the
event, links to tools and datasets used, and other information about the
project.  The databundles shown in the presentation are also on [Github][].
